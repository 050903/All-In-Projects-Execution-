public_key, private_key = generate_keys(key_size=2048)

# Encrypt message
message = "Hello World"
encrypted = encrypt(message, public_key)

# Decrypt message
decrypted = decrypt(encrypted, private_key)
print(f"Decrypted message: {decrypted}")
```

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices
1. Never use these implementations in production without proper security audit
2. Use established cryptographic libraries for real-world applications
3. Keep keys and sensitive data secure
4. Implement proper key management
5. Use appropriate key sizes

### Known Limitations
- Educational implementations may not be cryptographically secure
- Some algorithms are simplified for learning purposes
- Performance optimizations may be limited

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Include docstrings for all functions
- Write unit tests for new features

## Testing

Run tests using pytest:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Python path configuration

2. **Key Generation Issues**
   - Verify system has sufficient entropy
   - Check for proper random number generation

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Use appropriate key sizes
   - Optimize matrix operations
